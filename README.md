## Installation


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3737e5e-0b84-4802-b88c-a813c3841c6d


1. Inside of a project, navigate to > **"Customize"** > **"Rules"** > **"Create custom rule"**
2. Navigate to **"Do this..."** > **"External actions"** > **"Run script"** > **"Connect to Scripts by Asana"**
3. A new tab will open, displaying the Grant Permission page for the app. Click on **"Allow"**
4. You should now be authenticated and are now ready to start creating automation rules with Script Actions

## Usage: Default Script


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe56d8e-cc01-499b-bd20-b914b6f41afb


1. Inside of a project navigate to > **"Customize"** > **"Rules"** > **"Create custom rule"**
2. Select a trigger (e.g., **"Task is assigned"**):
3. Configure a condition for the **"+ Check if..."** step or delete that step
4. Navigate to  **"Do this..."** > **"External actions"** > **"Run script"** you should be presented with the script editor.
   This is where you will want to write/provide your script.
   
   Script Actions utilizes the [node-asana](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana) ([v3.X.X](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asana)) client library to make API calls to Asana.
   
   In each script action run, we provide you with the following variables:
   - `project_gid`: The project's gid
   - `task_gid`: The gid of the task that the rule triggered on
   - `workspace_gid`: The workspace gid

   You can utilize this information to write a Script Action scripts using the [node-asana](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana) ([v3.X.X](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asana)) client library.
   
   For this example, we will just uncomment the provided sample script. The sample script fetches the information about the triggered task and appends the text **"longer name"** to the end of the task name.
5. Click on the **"Publish rule"** button
6. Trigger your rule. In this scenario, we configured our rule to trigger when a task is assigned to a user in our project.

## Developing/Testing your script locally on your computer

The following is a way to write/test your script on your computer. You can copy the code below into your code editor and start working through the TODOs.

**Pre-requisite:**
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your computer 
2. Make sure you have `v3.X.X` version of [node-asana](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana) ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asana)) installed on your computer
3. Create a file for your script. Copy and paste the below script into that file. EX: `test.js`
4. Go through the TODOs outlined in the below script
5. Test your script `node <YOUR_SCRIPT_FILE_NAME>.js`. EX: `node test.js`

**TIP:** You can reference the ["Documentation for API Endpoints"](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana?tab=readme-ov-file#documentation-for-api-endpoints) section of [node-asana](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana) `README.md` to reference sample code and endpoints for your script.

2. Make sure you have v3.X.X version of the node-asana client library installed on your computer

4. Go through the TODOs outlined in this script
5. Test your script by running "node test.js" in your terminal

## Debugging/Errors/Logging

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76e1c26a-ab6c-4dda-8d9d-5515ddf6b16c

If your script executes but doesn't yield the expected outcome, it might be due to encountering an error.
When this happens you can use the `log` function to assist in diagnosing your issue.
You can view your logs by going to your script actions rule's **"Run history"** tab.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> - Logs have a character limit of 5,000 and will be truncated if they exceed this limit.
> - Script action scripts are enclosed in their own `try...catch` statement. If your script also contains a `try...catch` statement, errors may not appear as errors but may instead be displayed as logs in the **"Run history"** tab.

Example script action script with error:
```javascript
/**
 * What's in scope?
 * 1. (string) project_gid, workspace_gid, task_gid (only if triggered on a task)
 * 2. (function) log - this behaves like console.log and takes any number of parameters
 * 3. (object) *ApiInstance - for each group of APIs, an object containing functions to call the APIs; for example:
 *    tasksApiInstance.getTask(...)
 *    goalsApiInstance.addFollowers(...)
 * For more info, see https://github.com/Asana/node-asana
 */

const run = async () => {
   // Generate a random number
   const randomNum = Math.random();
   
   // Get information about the triggered task
   // The error here is that we provided a gid that does not exist in our domain
   const task = await tasksApiInstance.getTask("123");
};

run();

```

Example error shown in logs:
```
Encountered an error: {"name":"PromiseRejected","message":"Bad Request","stack":"    at run (eval.js:15)\n"}
Finished in N/A ms.
```
